"""SEO analysis.

Two independent things live here:

*Audit* looks only at your own listings and checks them against Etsy's documented
limits plus the mechanics of how Etsy search reads a listing — unused tag slots,
titles that bury the keyword past the truncation point, tags that no longer appear
anywhere in the title.

*Keyword research* reads the public marketplace through findAllListingsActive (the
one endpoint that needs no OAuth token) and reports what the listings ranking for a
term actually have in common: their tags, their title phrases, their price band.

Neither invents search-volume numbers. Etsy does not expose them, and any tool
claiming otherwise is guessing. What you get here is measured from real listings.
