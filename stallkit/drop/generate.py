"""Building a title and thirteen tags from a concept and what actually ranks.

There is no search volume to work from — Etsy publishes none — so this does the only
honest thing available: it looks at the listings Etsy returns for the concept and
reuses the vocabulary they share. That is a measurement, not a prediction, and the
interface says so wherever these numbers appear.

A title is built the way a good Etsy title reads: the concept and the product first
("Retro Mountain Sunset Shirt"), then three or four market phrases that each add a new
search ("Nature Lover Gift, Hiking Shirt, Outdoor Adventure Tee…"), and who it is for
last when the market says so. Single words on their own ("Gift", "Him") never make a
segment, a phrase that only repeats the title is skipped, and a phrase about another
product ("Vinyl Sticker" in a shirt's title, because the concept search also returned
stickers) is left out. Claims about the physical product — a size, a material, a
blank's brand, "personalized" — are only used when the seller's own template listing
makes them too: the market's shirts may be Comfort Colors, the seller's may not be.

Everything here is deliberately deterministic. The same design and the same market
sample produce the same title twice, which is what makes a hundred-product batch
reviewable: a seller who checks ten rows has learned something about the other ninety.

The hard limits are enforced at the point of construction, not checked afterwards, so
this module cannot emit something `listings.build_payload` would reject: 140
characters, Etsy's title characters (letters, digits, punctuation, maths symbols and
spaces; "%", ":", "&" and "+" once each), thirteen tags of at most twenty characters.

    The same rules a draft's tags follow, for a seller's existing listing (the SEO

    - a tag the listing already has, or that is one search with one it has
      (`seo._near_duplicates`), is never offered;
    - nor is an adhesive claim the listing does not make for the whole of itself (`text`:
      its own title, tags, materials and description): "removable" on a listing that sells
      paste-up paper too, or that never says it is removable;
    - at most GENERIC_SLOTS of the listing's tags may be the shop's generic ones (`wide`:
      the tags on at least half of the shop's listings; and the market's most used ones
      that hold no word of the listing's `title`), so a listing that has that many is
      offered none;
    - `shop` is the other listings' tags: a tag they use ranks lower, and none is offered
      that would put SHARED_TAGS_MIN of this listing's tags on one of them.

    Rows are (tag, listings using it), most used first.
