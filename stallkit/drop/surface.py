"""Making a flat design look printed on the product in the photo, with Pillow only.

`mockup.compose` places a design inside a print area. This module is what it calls
when the area asks for more than a flat paste:

* **realism** (0-100): the design takes the mockup's own light, folds and fabric
  texture. A shading map is read from the mockup's brightness inside the print area,
  normalised by the area's median, so a flat area changes nothing; darker folds
  darken the print (multiply) and highlights lift it (screen). Only brightness is
  used, never the garment's colour, so a design keeps its colours on a white or light
  shirt. On fabric the design also moves a little along the folds (displacement).
* **perspective**: a print area can be four corners instead of a rectangle; the
  design is mapped into them with a perspective transform.
* **curve** (0-100): the design wraps round a cylinder (a mug or a tumbler): squeezed
  towards the sides, a little darker there, and bent into a slight arc.

All of it is resolution independent: blur radii and displacements are fractions of
the print area, so the editor's 1400 px preview looks like the 2000+ px render.
