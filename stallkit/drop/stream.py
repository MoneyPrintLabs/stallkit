"""Designs in, Etsy drafts out, one product at a time, with live progress.

This is the web UI's engine behind Tasarım Yükle. It does what `drop auto` does —
composite, research, write the copy, validate, create the draft — but per product
instead of per batch, so a screen can show every product move through six steps:

    mockup -> research -> title -> tags -> check -> draft

Steps 1-5 are local work (plus read-only research) and run for up to `concurrency`
products at once. Step 6 writes to Etsy and runs on the calling thread, one product
at a time, in folder order. One product that fails does not stop the others.

The guarantees of `drop auto` hold here too, because they are the same code:
- the workspace's upload lock, so two runs never write at once;
- upload-history.json, written BEFORE each create and after every write, so a product
  that was attempted is never recreated automatically (see `automation`);
- `listings.prepare` validates every row and every image is fully decoded before its
  draft is created;
- nothing is ever published: rows never carry a listing_id or a state.

The template's type decides what a draft is. `physical` as always; `download` and
`both` drafts also get the product's download files, after its images: a loose design's
ORIGINAL file, or every file in a folder product's `dosyalar` / `files` subfolder (the
folder's own images stay its photos). A digital loose design always goes onto the
mockups (plus a small flat preview), never up as it is, even when it is opaque: it is
the file being sold. Step 5 (check) finds and validates the downloads before the
product's draft is created; a missing, oversized or refused file, a subfolder in
`dosyalar`, more than Etsy takes, or a photo that is also the download, is that
product's error (no_deliverable, nested_files, too_many_files, file_type,
file_too_large, file_empty, download_is_photo, ...). A made-to-order template needs no
download (made_to_order_no_file warns; a loose design is then not attached). A product
folder with only its `dosyalar` and no photos fails step 5 at once (no_photos), whatever
the template. A file that fails after the draft exists leaves the product `partial`,
and the history records `files_uploaded` next to `images_uploaded`.

The workspace's watermark (drop.watermark), when it is on and its scope takes this
template, is stamped on a copy of every picture a draft shows buyers: the mockups, the
flat render or preview, a folder's own photos, a photo uploaded as it is. The copies go
to the batch's `watermarked` folder (one name each); the seller's files and the download
files are never touched, and Etsy is told each stamped picture is watermarked. A picture
the mark cannot be put on fails its product (watermark_failed): it never goes up bare.

A loose design without see-through pixels is a finished photo and goes up as it is,
with an `as_is` warning (never silently). With `opaque="place"` (the page's choice for
the batch), one saved on a solid background (all four borders one colour,
mockup.ground_colour) has that background removed from the edges inwards and goes onto
the mockups like any transparent design; a real photo still goes up as it is.

Every picture a draft gets carries an alt text Etsy stores with it: the concept, and
on a mockup the mockup's product and colour ("Retro Mountain Sunset t-shirt, white").

The shop's info images (drop.infoimages: the materials, size and how-to cards every
listing ends with) go up after the product's own pictures, in the seller's order, each
with its own alt text, never watermarked. They are read, converted if they have to be,
and fully decoded once, before the plan goes out: one that cannot be used stops the run
before anything is sent. Photos and info images never pass Etsy's 20: the caller's
mockups are already capped for them (catalog.usage), and a product folder whose photos
leave too little room gets the first ones that fit (`info_images_cut` warns). They are
not in `images` (the product's own pictures, as the screen shows them) but in
`info_images`; the history entry lists their names.
Step 5 warns (never fails) when a picture's short side is under 1000 px
(`small_image`), or when a design had to be enlarged more than twice onto a mockup or
its flat render (`design_small`): both would look soft on Etsy.

`drop run` and `drop auto` are untouched; this module only reuses their pieces.

Events: `on_event(name, step, status, data)`, always with `data["index"]`.
- step in STEPS, status in running | done | warn | error; data may carry `images`
  (paths relative to the workspace root), `flat` (the one of them that is the plain
  design, not a mockup), `mode`, `title`, `tags`, `sampled`, `deliverables` (the
  download files, relative paths), `images_uploaded` / `images_total`,
  `files_uploaded` / `files_total`, `listing_id`, `problem` ({code, message, ...}).
- step "item": the product's outcome or waiting state; status in waiting | ok |
  partial | error | cancelled | checked (a dry run's good product).
- step "batch" (name ""), status "running", once before any product: the plan, with
  `listing_type`, each product's `files_total` (its download files, 0 if physical) and
  `info_images` (the names every draft ends with).
