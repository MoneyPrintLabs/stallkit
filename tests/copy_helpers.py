"""Invented marketplace samples for the title and tag builders, run through the real research.

A market is a handful of product groups, each with the title heads its listings open with,
the phrases they follow with and the tags they carry; a seeded generator draws 200 listings
from them, so the same call always gives the same sample. Nothing here is a real listing.
