"""Problems that only exist between listings.

`audit_listing` judges one listing at a time, which makes a whole class of problem
invisible: a shop where every listing carries the same tags scores a perfect 100 on
every listing while they all compete with each other for the same query. These tests
pin the check that catches it — it was found by hand on a real shop that the
per-listing audit had just declared flawless.
